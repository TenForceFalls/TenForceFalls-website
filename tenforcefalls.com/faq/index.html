<p>Nice of you to drop by. My name&rsquo;s Thomas, I am a student with long roots in the IT industry where I focus on Linux systems and webdev. This serves as a little &ldquo;about me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this-about">What is this about?</h3>

<p>Just my two cents on a lot of different topics. Sometimes it helps to write things down, lest I forget. Maybe someone else can even profit from that, who knows? In addition, it is interesting to look back on what you wrote in the past to reflect on how and why your views on certain matters change, or don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-kind-of-student-are-you">So what kind of student are you?</h3>

<p>I am a High school student currently in 10th grade in Colorado</p>

<h3 id="i-am-offended-by-xyz-you-wrote">I am offended by XYZ you wrote!</h3>

<p>So be offended. Nothing happens. &ndash;</p>

<h3 id="what-you-wrote-about-xyz-is-wrong">What you wrote about XYZ is wrong!</h3>

<p>Hey, nobody&rsquo;s perfect and being <strong>proven</strong> wrong is actually one of the best things that can happen to you as it helps you improve. So if you have something worthwhile to say and can back it up with facts or your reasoning is sound feel free to drop me a line. <small>(If none of the previous apply you can still drop me a line but you might get ignored, lectured, embarrassed, ridiculed, or whatever else floats my boat at the time)</small></p>

<h3 id="are-you-on-twitter-facebook-insert-social-media-site">Are you on twitter, facebook, &lt;insert social media site&gt;?</h3>

<p>Hell no!</p>

<h3 id="but-how-can-i-contact-you">But how can I contact you?</h3>

<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with e-mail? Look to the top right&hellip;</p>


<h3 id="is-there-an-rss-feed">Is there an RSS feed?</h3>

<p>no</a></p>
